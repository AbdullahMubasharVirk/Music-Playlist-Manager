Music Playlist Manager

Project Description:
The Music Playlist Manager is a web-based application designed to help users create, manage, and explore playlists with ease. Users can add songs, organize them into playlists, and control the privacy settings of their playlists. The application also includes an Admin Panel for authorized administrators to manage users, playlists, and songs securely.
All data, including users, playlists, songs, and session information, is stored using browser local storage, enabling the application to function entirely on the client side without requiring a backend server.
